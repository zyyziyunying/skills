# Communication Patterns

These are editing examples, not authorship tests or banned-word rules. Apply only when the pattern weakens the supplied text; preserve its facts, voice, uncertainty, and useful structure.

### 20. Collaborative Communication Artifacts

**Words to watch:** I hope this helps, Of course!, Certainly!, You're absolutely right!, Would you like..., Want me to...?, Want me to give examples?, Should I continue?, let me know, here is a...

**Problem:** Text meant as chatbot correspondence gets pasted as content.

**Before:**
> Here is an overview of the French Revolution. I hope this helps! Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any section.

**After:**
> [Start directly with the French Revolution overview.]


### 21. Knowledge-Cutoff Disclaimers and Speculative Gap-Filling

**Words to watch:** as of [date], Up to my last training update, While specific details are limited/scarce..., based on available information, not publicly available, maintains a low profile, keeps personal details private, prefers to stay out of the spotlight, likely [grew up/studied/began], it is believed that

**Problem:** Two related tells. (a) Older models leave hard knowledge-cutoff disclaimers in the text. (b) When a model can't find a source, it writes a paragraph *about* not finding one and then invents plausible filler to cover the gap. For a private person the guess almost always lands on the same stock phrases ("maintains a low profile," "keeps personal details private"), none of it sourced. Say what isn't known, or cut the sentence; don't dress a guess up as fact.

**Before (cutoff disclaimer):**
> While specific details about the company's founding are not extensively documented in readily available sources, it appears to have been established sometime in the 1990s.

**After:**
> Available sources do not confirm the founding date. Retain the 1990s estimate only if the supplied evidence supports it.

**Before (speculative gap-fill):**
> Information about her early life is not publicly available, suggesting she maintains a low profile and keeps personal details private. She likely grew up in a middle-class household, which shaped her later interest in education reform.

**After:**
> Her early life is not documented in the available sources. (Or omit the section.)


### 22. Sycophantic/Servile Tone

**Problem:** Overly positive, people-pleasing language.

**Before:**
> Great question! You're absolutely right that this is a complex topic. That's an excellent point about the economic factors.

**After:**
> The economic factors you mentioned are relevant here.


## FILLER AND HEDGING

### 23. Filler Phrases

**Before → After:**
- "In order to achieve this goal" → "To achieve this"
- "Due to the fact that it was raining" → "Because it was raining"
- "At this point in time" → "Now"
- "In the event that you need help" → "If you need help"
- "The system has the ability to process" → "The system can process"
- "It is important to note that the data shows" → "The data shows"


### 24. Excessive Hedging

**Problem:** Over-qualifying statements.

**Before:**
> It could potentially possibly be argued that the policy might have some effect on outcomes.

**After:**
> The policy may affect outcomes.


### 25. Generic Positive Conclusions

**Problem:** Vague upbeat endings.

**Before:**
> The future looks bright for the company. Exciting times lie ahead as they continue their journey toward excellence. This represents a major step in the right direction.

**After:**
> [Replace this generic conclusion with a concrete plan or result already supported by the text. If none exists, omit it.]


### 26. Hyphenated Word Pair Overuse

**Words to watch:** third-party, cross-functional, client-facing, data-driven, decision-making, well-known, high-quality, real-time, long-term, end-to-end

**Problem:** AI hyphenates these uniformly, including in predicate position (`the report is high-quality`). Humans hyphenate inconsistently — typically only when the compound is attributive (`a high-quality report`) and often dropping the hyphen otherwise (`the report is high quality`). Follow the document's style guide and conventional spelling; do not mechanically remove hyphens from established compounds.

**Before:**
> The cross-functional team delivered a high-quality, data-driven report. The team is cross-functional, the report is high-quality, and the methodology is data-driven.

**After:**
> The cross-functional team delivered a high-quality, data-driven report. The report is high quality.


### 27. Persuasive Authority Tropes

**Phrases to watch:** The real question is, at its core, in reality, what really matters, fundamentally, the deeper issue, the heart of the matter

**Problem:** LLMs use these phrases to pretend they are cutting through noise to some deeper truth, when the sentence that follows usually just restates an ordinary point with extra ceremony.

**Before:**
> The real question is whether teams can adapt. At its core, what really matters is organizational readiness.

**After:**
> Whether teams can adapt depends on the organization's readiness.


### 28. Signposting and Announcements

**Phrases to watch:** Let's dive in, let's explore, let's break this down, here's what you need to know, now let's look at, without further ado

**Problem:** LLMs announce what they are about to do instead of doing it. This meta-commentary slows the writing down and gives it a tutorial-script feel.

**Before:**
> Let's dive into how caching works in Next.js. Here's what you need to know.

**After:**
> [Start directly with the existing explanation of how caching works in Next.js.]


### 29. Fragmented Headers

**Signs to watch:** A heading followed by a one-line paragraph that simply restates the heading before the real content begins.

**Problem:** LLMs often add a generic sentence after a heading as a rhetorical warm-up. It usually adds nothing and makes the prose feel padded.

**Before:**
> ## Performance
>
> Speed matters.
>
> When users hit a slow page, they leave.

**After:**
> ## Performance
>
> When users hit a slow page, they leave.


### 30. Diff-Anchored Writing

**Problem:** Documentation or comments written as if narrating a change rather than describing the thing as it is. Unless the document is inherently version-scoped (changelogs, release notes, migration guides), it should read coherently without knowing what changed in the last commit.

**Before:**
> This function was added to replace the previous approach of iterating through all items, which caused O(n²) performance.

**After:**
> This function avoids the O(n²) cost of iterating through all items.


### 31. Manufactured Punchlines and Staccato Drama

**Problem:** LLMs often make every sentence land like a quotable closer, then stack short declarative fragments to manufacture drama. A single short sentence for emphasis is fine; a run of them starts to sound engineered.

**Before:**
> Then AlphaEvolve arrived. It had no preference for symmetry. No aesthetic prior. No nostalgia for human taste. The old rules were gone.

**After:**
> AlphaEvolve did not favor symmetry or human-looking designs, so the old rules no longer applied.


### 32. Aphorism Formulas

**Words to watch:** X is the Y of Z, X becomes a trap, X is not a tool but a mirror, the language of, the currency of, the architecture of

**Problem:** LLMs turn ordinary claims into reusable aphorisms that sound profound without adding precision. Replace the formula with the concrete claim it is gesturing at.

**Before:**
> Symmetry is the language of trust. Efficiency becomes a trap when teams forget the human layer.

**After:**
> People often associate symmetry with trust. Efficiency can become harmful when teams ignore the human side of their work.


### 33. Conversational Rhetorical Openers

**Phrases to watch:** Honestly?, Look, Here's the thing, The thing is, Let's be honest, Real talk, when used as standalone hooks or fake-candid pauses before an ordinary point.

**Problem:** LLMs open with a fake-candid hook to manufacture intimacy before delivering a routine claim. The tell is the theatrical pause-and-reveal: a one-word question or aside, then the "real" answer. A person being honest usually just says the thing.

**Before:**
> Is it worth the price? Honestly? It depends on how often you'll use it.

**After:**
> Whether it's worth the price depends on how often you'll use it.
